      <h3>Hello</h3>
      <p class="intro"> I am Pierce Mason a Biomedical Science graduate, aspiring to take up a career in IT. I've recently discovered my passion for software development through independant research and looking into career prospects. I discovered that this is the path I will walk down because I see similarities it shares with one of my favorite games I like to play during my free time, chess. They both require analytical thinking, problem solving, cognitive skills and the need to think many steps ahead and i believe these are few of the same qualities needed to suceed and enjoy software development.</p>
